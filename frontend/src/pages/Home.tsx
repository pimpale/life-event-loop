            Welcome to {APP_NAME}, an application built for a class project, but an application designed for the
            busiest of people. As students at UCLA, we know how frustrating it is to schedule classes,
            clubs, and homework so we made this application to help all kinds of people efficiently plan their schedule. We invite you to join us
            and be prepared for what the day has in store.

          <div>
            A scheduling app shouldn't have to take more than a few minutes to arrange the multiple events of your day; therefore, we use an algorithm modeled after simulated
            annealing to choose the best fit for certain events around your Commitments (immovable events such as classes, interviews, work, etc.).
            <br />
            With all your events in one place, our application gives you a simple TO-DO feed to see what is upcoming in your schedule, allowing you to take a quick glance and
            go back to working efficiently.
